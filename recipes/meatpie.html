    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh parsley</li>
        <li>¾ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>   
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the parsley, garlic, and oregano. 
            You can do this by hand with a sharp knife or use a food
            processor for quicker results. If you prefer a smoother 
            texture, pulse the ingredients in the food processor until 
            finely minced.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chopped parsley, garlic, and oregano to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with salt and black pepper to taste. Start with a small
            amount of salt and pepper and adjust according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Stir the ingredients together until well combined. Taste the chimichurri
            and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Let the chimichurri sauce sit at room temperature 
            for at least 15-30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve the chimichurri sauce alongside grilled meats such as steak, chicken, 
            or turkey. It can also be used as a marinade or dipping sauce for bread.</li>
        <li>Store any leftover chimichurri sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator 
            for up to a week. Allow it to come to room temperature before serving again, 
            as the olive oil may solidify when chilled.</li>
    </ol>
